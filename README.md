# STL-Voxelization-Error-Detection
Files written during URAP Fall 2022 undergraduate research to detect STL files that fail to voxelize properly. This repository is meant to be used alongside my [rotation and voxelization pipeline](https://github.com/marichard123/Voxelization-and-Rotation-Pipeline), but can be run alone.
